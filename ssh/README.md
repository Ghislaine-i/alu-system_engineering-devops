# SSH Project

## About
- Learn servers, SSH, and secure remote access
- Use RSA keys for authentication
- Connect to Ubuntu 20.04 servers

## Key Points

**Servers**: Computers that provide services, live in data centers

**SSH**: Secure Shell protocol for remote connections

**RSA Key Pair**:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa  # Creates public/private keys
ssh user@ip -i key # Connect with key
```

**Shebang**: `#!/usr/bin/env bash` is more portable than `/bin/bash`

## Skills
- Create SSH keys
- Connect to remote servers securely
- Configure SSH for easier access
